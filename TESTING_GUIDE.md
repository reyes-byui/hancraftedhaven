=== STOCK MANAGEMENT TESTING GUIDE ===

🚨 IMPORTANT: Users must be LOGGED IN to place orders!

📋 Testing Steps:

1. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000

2. FIRST - Create a customer account or log in:
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/login/customer
   - OR: http://localhost:3000/register/customer

3. Add items to your cart while logged in

4. Go to cart: http://localhost:3000/account/customer/cart

5. Complete checkout - stock should now update!

🔍 To verify stock updates:
   - Run: node debug-stock.js
   - Check the stock quantities before and after purchase

✅ Expected behavior:
   - Painting with 1 stock → 0 after purchase
   - Socks with 100 stock → 97 after buying 3

❌ What was happening before:
   - Customer was not logged in
   - Orders failed at authentication check
   - No orders created = No stock updates

🛠️ The stock management system is working correctly!
   The issue was authentication, not the stock system.
